                Context provides a way to share values like these between
                components without having to explicitly pass a prop through
                every level of the tree.

              <li>
                Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible

                When an element is styled with display:inline, it will not start
                on a new line, will only take up as much width as the content it
                contains, and will not cause a line break after it.

              <li>
                The difference between an inline element and an inline-block
                element is that an inline-block element can take up specified
                width and height.
              </li>
              <li>

                cause a line break after it.
